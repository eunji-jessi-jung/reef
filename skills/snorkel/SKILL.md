# reef:snorkel

Question-guided auto-discovery. Reads source code, uses the discovery question bank for direction, and produces 5-10 draft artifacts per source. No user input needed.

The key difference from a blind scan: snorkel reads the question bank and uses it to decide what to look at, what to document, and what to flag as unknown. Questions are the steering mechanism.

---

## Context Loading

1. **Find the reef root.** Look for `.reef/` in cwd or parent directories. If not found: "No reef found. Run `/reef:init` first."
2. **Read `.reef/project.json`** for project name, source paths, and service groupings. If no sources: "No sources configured. Run `/reef:init` to add source paths."
3. **Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/methodology.md`** — voice and personality.
4. **Read `.reef/questions.json`** — the discovery questions. These steer what you investigate and document.
5. **Read existing artifacts** in `artifacts/` to avoid duplicates.

### Resume detection

After loading context, check if snorkel has already partially run by comparing existing artifacts against what `project.json` services would produce:

- Count existing SYS-, SCH-, API-, CON-, GLOSSARY-, PROC-, RISK-, DEC-, PAT- artifacts
- Compare against the number of services and source repos configured

If artifacts already exist:

```
Found existing snorkel artifacts:
  SYS-: N (expected: M based on services)
  SCH-: N (expected: M based on schemas)
  CON-: N (expected: M based on service pairs)
  PROC-: N (auth + runtime)
  RISK-: N
  DEC-: N
  GLOSSARY-: N

Options:
  1. Continue — skip services that already have artifacts, generate the rest
  2. Start fresh — regenerate all artifacts from scratch
  3. Exit — reef looks complete, suggest /reef:scuba instead
```

If all expected artifacts exist, suggest `/reef:scuba` and exit unless the user insists.

Note: The artifact contract and templates are embedded inline in Step 5 below. You do not need to read them separately.

---

## Step 1 — Refresh the source index

Report: "Refreshing the source index..."

Run:
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/reef.py index --reef <reef-root>
```

Report results in natural language.

---

## Step 2 — Generate discovery questions

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/understanding-template.md`. For snorkel, focus on the **Snorkel (S1-S8)** questions.

For each source, do a quick structural scan:
- Read the 2-level directory tree
- Identify entry points, routers, models, config, tests
- Note the tech stack

Adapt the template questions to what you found. For each source, generate 8-15 specific questions:
- **Concrete, not generic.** Instead of "What are the core entities?", write "What are the core entities in order-service and how do Order, LineItem, and Payment relate?" if you see those model names.
- **Answerable from code.** Every question should be something you can investigate by reading source files.
- **Ordered by discovery priority:** System boundaries first, then data model, then API surface, then cross-system.

For multi-source reefs, add cross-system questions using the service groupings:
- **Within a service**: "How do pay-gateway and pay-ledger divide responsibilities within Payments?"
- **Across services**: "What data flows from Orders to Fulfillment?" / "What contracts exist between Payments and Inventory?"

Write to `.reef/questions.json`:
```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "Q-001",
      "text": "What are the system boundaries and external dependencies of order-service?",
      "source": "order-service",
      "phase": "snorkel",
      "added": "2026-04-10",
      "status": "unanswered"
    }
  ]
}
```

Report: "Generated N discovery questions across M sources."

Show the questions briefly — a numbered list, grouped by service. Do not ask for approval. Move on.

---

## Step 3 — Question-guided structural scan

For each source in project.json:

1. Read the 2-level directory tree.
2. Read README.md if present.
3. Identify entry points, routers/handlers, models/schemas, config, tests, API definitions.
4. Note the tech stack.
5. Flag cross-system boundaries (imports, HTTP clients, shared schemas).

**Check for multiple applications within a single source.** Some repos are internal monorepos — one git repo containing multiple independent applications with their own entry points, models, databases, or API surfaces. Common signals:
- Multiple `main.py` / `app.py` entry points in separate directories
- Multiple FastAPI/Flask/Express apps under an `applications/`, `services/`, or `apps/` directory
- Separate database configurations or ORM model sets per sub-directory
- A workspace orchestrator (Nx, Turborepo, Cargo workspace) managing multiple packages

When you find this: treat each sub-application as a **distinct sub-domain**. Generate separate SCH- and API- artifacts for each (e.g., `SCH-PAYMENTS-GATEWAY`, `SCH-PAYMENTS-LEDGER`, `API-PAYMENTS-GATEWAY`, `API-PAYMENTS-LEDGER`), not one combined artifact for the whole repo. The SYS- artifact stays as one per service — it describes the overall system and references the per-app schema/API artifacts.

The "3-6 artifacts per source" target scales up for multi-app sources. A repo with 4 independent apps may warrant 8-12 artifacts.

**Now use the question bank to go deeper.** For each question tagged to this source (or untagged):

- **Orientation questions** (boundaries, dependencies): Read entry points, config, dependency files. Trace imports to external services. Identify databases, queues, auth providers.
- **Data questions** (entities, relationships, state machines): Read model files thoroughly. Map entity names, relationships, field types. Look for status/state fields that indicate lifecycles.
- **Behavior questions** (workflows, error handling): Read router/handler files. Trace the main request paths. Note middleware, decorators, and error handlers.
- **Cross-system questions**: Search for HTTP clients, message publishers/consumers, shared schema imports. Map which source calls which.

For each question you can answer from code, note:
- **Fact**: what you found
- **Source**: which files (relative paths)
- **Confidence**: high (directly visible in code) / medium (inferred from structure) / low (guessing)
- **Open questions**: what you cannot determine from a surface read

Report progress as you go: "Reading service-a's model layer — found 14 SQLAlchemy models across 6 files...", "Tracing the auth middleware — JWT validation with role-based access control...", "Found HTTP client for service-b in clients/service_b.py — flagging as cross-system boundary..."

---

## Step 4 — Generate artifacts

Generate artifacts guided by what you learned. Every service has a **mandatory minimum set** — do not move to the next service until these are written.

### Mandatory per-service artifacts (generate ALL of these)

1. **SYS-** — one per service, always. The entry point artifact. Use orientation question findings.
2. **SCH-** — one per distinct data model. If the source has multiple independent apps with separate data models, generate one SCH- per app (e.g., SCH-PAYMENTS-GATEWAY, SCH-PAYMENTS-LEDGER). Even a thin draft with entity names and relationships is better than nothing — scuba will upgrade it from extracted ERDs.
3. **API-** — one per distinct API surface. Same multi-app rule as SCH-. Even a thin draft listing router files and endpoint groups is better than nothing — scuba will upgrade it from extracted OpenAPI specs.
4. **PROC- auth** — one per service. Every service has auth. Document the mechanism (JWT, API key, OAuth, session), enforcement point (middleware, decorator, gateway), and identity provider. 3-5 Key Facts.
5. **GLOSSARY-{SERVICE}** — one per service. Extract domain terms found during Step 3 scan. Template: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/templates/glossary-service.md`.
6. **RISK-** — one per service. Scan for TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX, bare exceptions, hardcoded URLs/credentials, disabled tests. Group by theme. Severity always "medium" at snorkel depth. Template: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/templates/risk-service.md`. If genuinely no signals found (rare), skip with a note.

### Cross-service artifacts (generate ALL of these)

7. **CON-** — one per service pair. For N services, generate exactly N×(N-1)/2 contracts. Name both parties, describe what flows between them (or note "no detected integration"). This is a completeness requirement — do not generate "some" and move on. **Domain labeling:** Cross-system artifacts (CON- between services, entity comparisons, unified glossary) must use the project-level domain slug from `project.json`, not a single service's domain. This ensures cross-system artifacts are discoverable and don't create false coverage gaps.
8. **GLOSSARY-** unified — one for the whole reef. Cross-service disambiguation (use the project-level domain slug from `project.json`). If you already have per-service glossaries, the unified glossary resolves conflicts and notes where the same term means different things.

### Conditional artifacts (generate when signal is present)

9. **PROC- runtime architecture** — generate when docker-compose, Helm, multiple entry points, or background workers are detected. 3-5 Key Facts on runtime topology.
10. **DEC-** for observable decisions — generate when the scan reveals a non-obvious technology or architecture choice (dual databases, custom auth, specific queue, sync-over-async). Stub with Context, Decision, and `known_unknowns: ["Rationale not available from code alone"]`.

### Minimum count validation

Before finishing a service, count its artifacts against this checklist:

```
Service {name} artifact count:
  SYS-:      {N} (minimum: 1)
  SCH-:      {N} (minimum: 1 per data model)
  API-:      {N} (minimum: 1 per API surface)
  PROC-auth: {N} (minimum: 1)
  GLOSSARY-: {N} (minimum: 1)
  RISK-:     {N} (minimum: 1)
  Total:     {N} (minimum: 6 per single-app service)
```

If any mandatory type shows 0, go back and generate it before proceeding. A thin draft is always better than a missing artifact — scuba needs the skeleton to build on.

**Target: 6-10 artifacts per source.** For a 4-source reef, that means 24-40 service artifacts + N×(N-1)/2 contracts + 1 unified glossary. Multi-app sources (monorepos with 3+ sub-apps) should generate 8-12 artifacts.

**Parallelism:** Artifact generation is independent per service. Use the Agent tool to generate all artifacts for multiple services concurrently — launch one agent per service, each responsible for that service's full artifact batch (SYS-, SCH-, API-, PROC-, RISK-, etc.). All agents in a single message.

### For each artifact

**a. Generate frontmatter** using this exact field order. Do NOT deviate:

```yaml
---
id: "SYS-ORDERS"                        # uppercase prefix + uppercase slug
type: "system"                           # lowercase type matching prefix
title: "Order Management Service"        # Title Case — capitalize major words
domain: "orders"                         # domain slug
status: "draft"                          # always "draft" for snorkel
last_verified: 2026-04-10               # unquoted ISO date, today
freshness_note: "snorkel-depth scan"     # never empty
freshness_triggers:                      # sorted alphabetically
  - "src/models/order.py"
  - "src/services/workflow.py"
known_unknowns:                          # generous — list what you could NOT answer
  - "Retry logic for failed payments unclear"
tags:
  - orders
  - fastapi
aliases:
  - "OMS"
relates_to:                              # sorted by target
  - type: "feeds"
    target: "[[SYS-FULFILLMENT]]"
sources:                                 # sorted by ref
  - category: "implementation"
    type: "github"
    ref: "src/main.py"
notes: ""
---
```

**b. Write body sections** based on artifact type:

| Type | Prefix | Required Sections |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| System | SYS- | Overview, Key Facts, Responsibilities, Core Concepts, Related |
| Schema | SCH- | Overview, Key Facts, Entities (with field tables), Related |
| API | API- | Overview, Key Facts, Source of Truth, Resource Map (endpoint tables), Related |
| Process | PROC- | Purpose, Key Facts, then ONE of: States (lifecycle), Steps (workflow), Phases (pipeline), Triggers (event-driven), Related |
| Decision | DEC- | Context, Decision, Key Facts, Rationale, Consequences (Positive/Negative/Neutral), Related |
| Glossary | GLOSSARY- | Overview, Terms (table: Term / Definition / See Also), Related |
| Contract | CON- | Parties, Key Facts, Agreement, Current State, Related |
| Risk | RISK- | Description, Key Facts, Impact, Severity+Resolution, Related |

**Key Facts format** (required for all types except Glossary):
```markdown
## Key Facts
- Order status transitions enforced at service layer → src/services/order.py
- Payment webhook triggers fulfillment flow → src/handlers/payment_webhook.py
- No retry mechanism for failed inventory checks → known gap
```

Each fact is an atomic, verifiable claim linked to its source with `→`.

**c. Write the file** to the correct subdirectory. Filename: lowercase ID + `.md` (e.g., `sys-orders.md`).

**d. Lint and snapshot:**
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/reef.py lint --reef <reef-root>
```
Parse the JSON output, filter to errors/warnings for this artifact's ID only. If any **errors** are found, fix them immediately before moving on (ID casing, missing fields, filename mismatch — see `/reef:lint` auto-fix rules). Then snapshot:
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/reef.py snapshot <artifact-id-lowercase> --reef <reef-root>
```

**e. Present to the user.** Show each artifact one at a time as it's written.

---

## Step 5 — Spec-driven artifact upgrade

If `/reef:source` ran in parallel with snorkel, extracted API specs and ERDs are now available in `sources/apis/` and `sources/schemas/`. Use them to upgrade draft artifacts from surface-level summaries to spec-accurate documentation.

**When to run:** Only if `sources/apis/` or `sources/schemas/` contain extracted specs. If both directories are empty, skip to Step 6 — source extraction may not have been configured or may still be running.

**For each API- artifact with `freshness_note` containing "snorkel":**

1. Find the matching spec: `sources/apis/{service}/{sub}/openapi.json`.
2. Read the full OpenAPI spec — extract all endpoints, methods, request/response schemas, auth requirements, tags.
3. Rewrite the artifact body with complete endpoint documentation:
   - Group endpoints by tag/resource
   - Include request parameters and response schemas
   - Note auth requirements per endpoint
   - List error codes where specified
4. Update frontmatter:
   - `freshness_note: "upgraded from extracted OpenAPI spec"`
   - `known_unknowns`: remove items answered by the spec, keep others
   - Add `openapi.json` to `sources` list
5. Follow the full artifact contract (field order, validation, determinism rules).
6. Run snapshot after writing.

**For each SCH- artifact with `freshness_note` containing "snorkel":**

1. Find the matching schema: `sources/schemas/{service}/{sub}/schema.md`.
2. Read the full ERD — extract all tables/collections, fields, types, relationships.
3. Rewrite the artifact body with complete data model documentation:
   - All tables with full field lists (types, nullability, PK/FK, indexes)
   - Relationship cardinalities
   - **Mermaid `erDiagram` block (REQUIRED)** — this is a hard requirement, not optional. Every SCH- upgraded from an ERD must include a Mermaid ER diagram. Keep diagrams concise: max 15 entities per diagram, split into multiple diagrams if larger.
4. Update frontmatter same as API artifacts.
5. Run snapshot after writing.

**Quality mandates for spec-driven upgrades:**

- Every SCH- upgraded from an ERD **must** include a Mermaid `erDiagram` block. No exceptions.
- Every API- upgraded from OpenAPI **must** include one worked JSON request/response example for the most representative endpoint. Place it in a `### Worked Example` subsection after the endpoint tables.

**Parallelism:** Each artifact upgrade is independent. Use the Agent tool to upgrade all eligible SCH- and API- artifacts concurrently — launch one agent per artifact, all in a single message.

**After all upgrades:** Report what was upgraded:

```
Upgraded N artifacts from extracted specs:
- api-{service}: {N} endpoints (was {M} in draft)
- sch-{service}: {N} tables (was {M} in draft)
```

---

## Step 6 — Glossary cross-check

After all artifacts are written (including the GLOSSARY- artifact), do a glossary validation pass:

1. Read the GLOSSARY- artifact(s).
2. For each non-glossary artifact, scan Key Facts, Overview, and Core Concepts for domain terms defined in the glossary.
3. If any term is used with a meaning that contradicts the glossary definition, fix the artifact to align — or update the glossary if the artifact's usage is more accurate.
4. If any glossary-defined term is used ambiguously (e.g., "Case" without specifying which service when the glossary flags it as a disambiguation), add the qualifier.

This prevents drift between artifacts and the glossary from the very first generation. It is fast — just a string-matching pass over terms, not a deep re-read.

---

## Step 7 — Bidirectional linking pass

After all artifacts are written, do a linking pass to ensure the Obsidian graph is fully connected:

1. Read the frontmatter of every artifact just generated.
2. For each `relates_to` entry, check whether the target artifact links back. For example, if `SCH-ORDERS-CORE` has `relates_to: [{type: "parent", target: "[[SYS-ORDERS]]"}]`, then `SYS-ORDERS` must have a corresponding entry pointing to `SCH-ORDERS-CORE` (e.g., `{type: "refines", target: "[[SCH-ORDERS-CORE]]"}`).
3. If the reverse link is missing, add it. Use the appropriate inverse relationship:
   - `parent` ↔ `refines` (child→parent / parent→child)
   - `depends_on` ↔ `feeds` (consumer→producer / producer→consumer)
   - `constrains` — add reverse `constrains` on the target
   - `integrates_with` — always bidirectional, add if missing
4. Also ensure the `## Related` section's wikilinks match the updated `relates_to` frontmatter.
5. Re-snapshot any artifact that was modified.

This pass is critical for Obsidian graph view — unlinked nodes appear as disconnected islands.

---

## Step 8 — Update question bank

After generating artifacts, update `.reef/questions.json`:

- Mark questions as `"answered"` if the artifacts fully address them
- Mark as `"partial"` if artifacts touch on it but gaps remain
- Leave as `"unanswered"` if the snorkel pass couldn't address them

This gives `/reef:test` and `/reef:scuba` a clear picture of what's covered and what needs deeper work.

---

## Step 9 — Wrap up

Run:
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/reef.py rebuild-index --reef <reef-root>
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/reef.py rebuild-map --reef <reef-root>
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/reef.py log "Snorkel pass: generated N artifacts, answered M/T questions" --reef <reef-root>
```

**Run the audit** to verify mandatory minimums are met:
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/reef.py audit --reef <reef-root>
```

If the audit reports missing artifacts, generate them now before proceeding. Each missing artifact is independent — launch one agent per gap. A thin draft is always better than a missing artifact.

Then run the health report:
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/reef.py lint --reef <reef-root>
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/reef.py diff --reef <reef-root>
```

Render a compact health summary using this exact format (copy the Unicode box-drawing characters directly):

```
Reef Health — {project name}                         {date}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Sources          Files    Seen   Deep   Freshness
────────────────────────────────────────────────
{source}         {N}      {N}    {N}    {bar} {status}

Artifacts        Total    Fresh  Aging  Stale  Errors
────────────────────────────────────────────────
{TYPE-}          {N}      {N}    {N}    {N}    {N}

Issues: {N} errors · {N} warnings · {N} info
```

**Freshness bar:** 8 characters wide using `█` (filled) and `░` (empty), proportional to coverage. Example: `████████░░` = fresh, `██░░░░░░░░` = stale.
**Freshness status:** `fresh` (no source changes), `aging` (some changes), `stale` (many changes or old `last_verified`).

Populate from lint and diff output. Show every source and artifact type, even if counts are zero. This table must render completely — do not skip or truncate it.

Summarize:
- Artifacts created (list IDs and one-line descriptions)
- Questions answered vs remaining
- Key gaps discovered (the most important known_unknowns across artifacts)

Then suggest next steps:

"The snorkel pass answered M of T discovery questions. Draft artifacts are in place with honest gaps.

Next steps:
- `/reef:scuba` — automated deepening + Socratic exploration. Generates advanced artifacts (lifecycles, auth boundaries, dependency maps) then works through unanswered questions with you.
- `/reef:deep` — exhaustive line-by-line tracing of a specific area.
- `/reef:test` — see how well the reef answers your questions right now."

If the key gaps include things that existing documents could answer (architecture decisions, deployment topology, authorization models, business rules), add:

"Code is the foundation, but some of these gaps live outside the codebase.
Your reef has folders ready for real-world context:

  sources/context/requirements/   — SRDs, PRDs, specs
  sources/context/decisions/      — ADRs, design docs, architecture proposals
  sources/context/processes/      — SOPs, runbooks, playbooks
  sources/context/meetings/       — meeting notes, knowledge sharing transcripts
  sources/context/roadmaps/       — roadmaps, OKRs, timelines
  sources/raw/                    — anything else (diagrams, CSVs, PDFs)

Drop whatever you have. The next pass (/reef:scuba) will use it all."

Only mention this if the gaps are genuinely the kind that docs would fill. Do not mention it if the gaps are code-level (e.g., "unclear error handling in module X").

Also mention: "Artifacts are wikilinked — you can open the reef directory as an Obsidian vault to explore the knowledge graph."

---

## Voice and Personality

- Curious Researcher voice. Present-participle narration.
- No emojis. No exclamation marks.
- Honest about uncertainty. Generous known_unknowns. When guessing, say so.
- Flag cross-system boundaries immediately when found.
- Do not narrate every file. Summarize at the source level, call out interesting findings.

---

## Key Rules

- **Follow the frontmatter schema and body sections in Step 4 exactly.**
- **Questions steer discovery.** Don't just scan blindly — use the question bank to decide what to investigate.
- **Artifact IDs**: uppercase prefix + uppercase domain/name, hyphen-separated.
- **Filenames**: lowercase ID + `.md`.
- **Source refs always relative** to source root.
- **Stop when diminishing returns.** If a source is simple, 2-3 artifacts is fine. Don't pad.
- **Cross-system contracts always-on.** When code calls another system, flag it.
- **No user input.** Snorkel is fully automated. All interactive steps (service grouping, extract confirmation) happen in init before snorkel is triggered. Read, generate, report.

---

## If Called Without Init

If `.reef/questions.json` is empty or missing, Step 2 (Generate discovery questions) will create it. If `.reef/project.json` has no service groupings, snorkel will proceed without them — questions will be per-repo rather than per-service. Suggest the user run `/reef:init` for a better experience. Snorkel is self-sufficient — it can run standalone on any reef that has been scaffolded and indexed.

---

## Error Handling

- **No reef found**: "No reef found. Run `/reef:init` first."
- **No sources**: "No sources configured. Run `/reef:init` to add source paths."
- **Source path missing**: warn, skip, continue with others.
- **reef.py fails**: report the error. Do not silently swallow.
- **No structures found in a source**: still generate a SYS- artifact with generous known_unknowns.
